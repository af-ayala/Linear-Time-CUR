# Linear-time CUR
We present MATLAB codes for algorithms described in the paper:
*"Linear-time CUR approximation of BEM matrices"*
Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics.
By Alan Ayala, Xavier Claeys and Laura Grigori.

# CUR_GCS.m
Corresponds to Algorithm 2 in the paper: CUR via Geometric sampling.

# GC_Sampling.m
Sampling columns using Gravity centers approach.

# NN_Sampling.m
Sampling columns using Nearest-Neighbors approach.
